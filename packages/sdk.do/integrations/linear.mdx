# Linear Issue Tracking & Project Management

Linear is a modern issue tracking and project management tool built for high-performance software teams. It provides fast, focused workflows for managing issues, projects, cycles, and team collaboration.

## Features

- **Fast Issue Tracking**: Streamlined issue creation and management with keyboard shortcuts
- **Projects & Roadmaps**: Track progress toward goals with projects and milestones
- **Sprint Planning**: Plan work in time-boxed cycles with automatic scheduling
- **Team Collaboration**: Comments, mentions, and notifications for seamless teamwork
- **Workflow Automation**: Customizable workflows and states for your team's process
- **GraphQL API**: Powerful, flexible API built on GraphQL
- **Webhooks**: Real-time event notifications for integrations
- **Native Apps**: Desktop and mobile apps with offline support

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { LinearClient } from '@dotdo/sdk.do/integrations/linear'

const linear = new LinearClient({
  apiKey: process.env.LINEAR_API_KEY,
})

// Create an issue
const issue = await linear.createIssue({
  teamId: 'team_abc123',
  title: 'Bug: Application crashes on startup',
  description: 'Detailed description...',
  priority: 1, // Urgent
  labelIds: ['label_bug', 'label_critical'],
})

// Search issues
const { nodes: issues } = await linear.searchIssues({
  filter: {
    team: { id: { eq: 'team_abc123' } },
    state: { type: { eq: 'started' } },
  },
  first: 50,
})
```

## Authentication

### Personal API Key

For personal integrations and scripts:

1. Go to Linear Settings → API → Personal API keys
2. Click "Create key"
3. Copy the key (starts with `lin_api_`)
4. Use in your application:

```typescript
const linear = new LinearClient({
  apiKey: 'lin_api_xxxxxxxxxxxxx',
})
```

### OAuth 2.0

For public applications requiring user authorization:

1. Create an OAuth application in Linear settings
2. Implement OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow:

```typescript
// Step 1: Redirect user to authorization URL
const authUrl = `https://linear.app/oauth/authorize?client_id=${clientId}&redirect_uri=${redirectUri}&scope=read,write&response_type=code`

// Step 2: Exchange authorization code for access token
const tokenResponse = await fetch('https://api.linear.app/oauth/token', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    grant_type: 'authorization_code',
    client_id: clientId,
    client_secret: clientSecret,
    redirect_uri: redirectUri,
    code: authorizationCode,
  }),
})

const { access_token } = await tokenResponse.json()

// Step 3: Use access token with Linear client
const linear = new LinearClient({
  apiKey: access_token,
})
```

**OAuth Scopes:**

- `read` - Read access to all resources
- `write` - Create, update, and delete resources
- `admin` - Administrative access (manage team settings, users)

## Resources

### Issues

Issues are the core work items in Linear. They can represent bugs, features, tasks, or any unit of work.

```typescript
// Create an issue
const issue = await linear.createIssue({
  teamId: 'team_abc123',
  title: 'Implement user authentication',
  description: 'Add OAuth 2.0 support with GitHub and Google providers',
  priority: 2, // High: 0=None, 1=Urgent, 2=High, 3=Medium, 4=Low
  estimate: 5, // Story points or complexity estimate
  assigneeId: 'user_xyz789',
  stateId: 'state_backlog',
  labelIds: ['label_feature', 'label_backend'],
  dueDate: '2025-12-31',
})

// Get an issue
const issue = await linear.getIssue('issue_def456')
console.log(issue.title, issue.identifier, issue.url)

// Update an issue
await linear.updateIssue('issue_def456', {
  title: 'Updated title',
  stateId: 'state_in_progress',
  priority: 1,
  assigneeId: 'user_new_assignee',
})

// List issues with pagination
const { nodes: issues, pageInfo } = await linear.listIssues({
  first: 100,
  after: cursor,
  includeArchived: false,
})

// Search with filters
const { nodes: bugs } = await linear.searchIssues({
  filter: {
    team: { id: { eq: 'team_abc123' } },
    labels: { some: { id: { eq: 'label_bug' } } },
    state: { type: { eq: 'started' } },
    priority: { eq: 1 },
  },
  first: 50,
})

// Delete (archive) an issue
await linear.deleteIssue('issue_def456')
```

### Projects

Projects group related issues and track progress toward goals.

```typescript
// Create a project
const project = await linear.createProject({
  name: 'Q1 2025 Roadmap',
  description: 'Key initiatives for Q1',
  teamIds: ['team_abc123', 'team_def456'],
  leadId: 'user_xyz789',
  startDate: '2025-01-01',
  targetDate: '2025-03-31',
  icon: '🚀',
  color: '#4287f5',
})

// Update project
await linear.updateProject('project_ghi789', {
  name: 'Updated Project Name',
  state: 'started',
  targetDate: '2025-04-15',
})

// List projects
const { nodes: projects } = await linear.listProjects({
  first: 50,
  includeArchived: false,
})
```

### Teams

Teams organize work and members in your Linear workspace.

```typescript
// Get a team
const team = await linear.getTeam('team_abc123')
console.log(team.name, team.key, team.cyclesEnabled)

// List all teams
const { nodes: teams } = await linear.listTeams()

// Get team members
const members = await linear.getTeamMembers('team_abc123')
for (const member of members) {
  console.log(member.name, member.email, member.admin)
}
```

### Users

Users are members of your Linear organization.

```typescript
// Get current user
const me = await linear.getMe()
console.log(me.name, me.email, me.admin)

// Get a specific user
const user = await linear.getUser('user_xyz789')

// List all users
const { nodes: users } = await linear.listUsers({
  first: 100,
})
```

### Comments

Comments enable team collaboration on issues.

```typescript
// Create a comment
const comment = await linear.createComment({
  issueId: 'issue_def456',
  body: 'This is a comment with **markdown** support!',
})

// Update a comment
await linear.updateComment('comment_jkl012', {
  body: 'Updated comment text',
})

// Delete a comment
await linear.deleteComment('comment_jkl012')
```

### Labels

Labels categorize and organize issues.

```typescript
// Create a label
const label = await linear.createLabel({
  teamId: 'team_abc123',
  name: 'bug',
  description: "Something isn't working",
  color: '#d73a4a',
})

// Update a label
await linear.updateLabel('label_mno345', {
  name: 'critical-bug',
  color: '#b60205',
})

// List labels
const { nodes: labels } = await linear.listLabels('team_abc123')
```

### Workflow States

Workflow states define the stages of issue progress.

```typescript
// Get workflow states for a team
const { nodes: states } = await linear.listWorkflowStates('team_abc123')

// Find specific state
const inProgressState = states.find((s) => s.type === 'started' || s.name.toLowerCase().includes('progress'))

// Move issue to state
await linear.updateIssue('issue_def456', {
  stateId: inProgressState.id,
})
```

### Cycles

Cycles are time-boxed iterations for planning work (sprints).

```typescript
// Get active cycle
const cycle = await linear.activeCycle('team_abc123')
if (cycle) {
  console.log('Current cycle:', cycle.name)
  console.log('Progress:', cycle.progress)
}

// List cycles
const { nodes: cycles } = await linear.listCycles({ team: { id: { eq: 'team_abc123' } } }, { first: 10 })
```

### Milestones

Milestones mark significant points in project timelines.

```typescript
// Create a milestone
const milestone = await linear.createMilestone({
  name: 'Beta Release',
  description: 'Launch beta version',
  targetDate: '2025-06-30',
})

// Update milestone
await linear.updateMilestone('milestone_pqr678', {
  name: 'Beta Release v2',
  targetDate: '2025-07-15',
})
```

## Webhooks

Linear sends webhooks for real-time event notifications.

### Webhook Setup

1. Go to Settings → API → Webhooks
2. Click "Create webhook"
3. Enter your webhook URL
4. Select events to subscribe to
5. Copy the webhook secret

### Webhook Verification

Always verify webhook signatures to ensure authenticity:

```typescript
import { LinearWebhooks } from '@dotdo/sdk.do/integrations/linear'

// In your webhook handler (e.g., Cloudflare Worker)
export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env) {
    const signature = request.headers.get('linear-signature')
    const payload = await request.text()

    try {
      // Verify and parse webhook
      const event = LinearWebhooks.verifyAndParse(payload, signature, env.LINEAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET)

      // Handle event
      console.log('Event:', event.type, event.action)
      console.log('Data:', event.data)

      return new Response('OK', { status: 200 })
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Webhook error:', error)
      return new Response('Webhook Error', { status: 400 })
    }
  },
}
```

### Event Router

Use the event router for clean webhook handling:

```typescript
import { EventRouter, LinearWebhooks } from '@dotdo/sdk.do/integrations/linear'

const router = new EventRouter()

// Handle specific events
router.on('Issue', 'create', async (event, data) => {
  console.log('New issue created:', data.title)
  // Auto-label, assign, notify team, etc.
})

router.on('Issue', 'update', async (event, data) => {
  console.log('Issue updated:', data.id)
  console.log('Changed fields:', event.updatedFrom)
})

router.on('Comment', 'create', async (event, data) => {
  console.log('New comment:', data.body)
  // Trigger notifications, integrations
})

// Route incoming webhook
await router.handle(event)
```

### Common Webhook Events

- **Issue Events**: `Issue.create`, `Issue.update`, `Issue.remove`
- **Comment Events**: `Comment.create`, `Comment.update`, `Comment.remove`
- **Project Events**: `Project.create`, `Project.update`, `Project.remove`
- **Cycle Events**: `Cycle.create`, `Cycle.update`, `Cycle.remove`
- **Label Events**: `IssueLabel.create`, `IssueLabel.update`, `IssueLabel.remove`

## Error Handling

All methods throw `LinearIntegrationError` on failure:

```typescript
import { LinearIntegrationError } from '@dotdo/sdk.do/integrations/linear'

try {
  const issue = await linear.getIssue('nonexistent_issue')
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof LinearIntegrationError) {
    console.error('Error:', error.code, error.message)

    // Check error type
    if (error.isAuthenticationError()) {
      console.log('Invalid API key')
    } else if (error.isNotFoundError()) {
      console.log('Issue not found')
    } else if (error.isRateLimitError()) {
      console.log('Rate limit exceeded')
    }

    // Retry if possible
    if (error.isRetriable()) {
      // Implement exponential backoff
    }
  }
}
```

## Rate Limits

Linear enforces rate limits:

- **100 requests/second** (burst)
- **1,000 requests/hour**

Always implement retry logic with exponential backoff for production systems.

## Best Practices

1. **Use OAuth for public apps** - Personal API keys are for personal use only
2. **Always verify webhook signatures** - Prevent unauthorized webhook calls
3. **Implement retry logic** - Handle rate limits and transient failures gracefully
4. **Use pagination** - Don't fetch all data at once for large result sets
5. **Cache workflow states and labels** - These rarely change, reduce API calls
6. **Filter server-side** - Use GraphQL filters instead of client-side filtering
7. **Handle errors properly** - Check error types and implement appropriate handling
8. **Store API keys securely** - Never expose API keys in client-side code

## Common Use Cases

### Auto-triage Issues

```typescript
router.on('Issue', 'create', async (event, data) => {
  if (data.labels?.some((l) => l.name === 'bug')) {
    // Assign bugs to bug team lead
    const members = await linear.getTeamMembers(data.teamId)
    const bugLead = members.find((m) => m.admin)

    if (bugLead) {
      await linear.updateIssue(data.id, {
        assigneeId: bugLead.id,
        priority: 2, // High priority
      })
    }
  }
})
```

### Sync to External System

```typescript
router.on('Issue', async (event, data) => {
  // Sync to your database
  await db.issues.upsert({
    where: { linearId: data.id },
    create: {
      linearId: data.id,
      title: data.title,
      status: data.state?.name,
      priority: data.priority,
    },
    update: {
      title: data.title,
      status: data.state?.name,
      priority: data.priority,
    },
  })
})
```

### Generate Sprint Reports

```typescript
async function generateSprintReport(teamId: string) {
  const cycle = await linear.activeCycle(teamId)

  if (!cycle) {
    console.log('No active cycle')
    return
  }

  const { nodes: issues } = await linear.searchIssues({
    filter: { cycle: { id: { eq: cycle.id } } },
    first: 1000,
  })

  const completed = issues.filter((i) => i.completedAt)
  const inProgress = issues.filter((i) => i.startedAt && !i.completedAt)

  console.log(`Sprint: ${cycle.name}`)
  console.log(`Progress: ${cycle.progress}%`)
  console.log(`Completed: ${completed.length}/${issues.length}`)
}
```
