# Database

Use the `DB()` helper to define your application's models. Models are typed and automatically persisted.

```ts
import { DB } from 'workflows.do'

const db = DB({
  ideas: {
    concept: String,
    status: String,
  },
  leanCanvas: {},
})
```

After defining the models you can query and update them as shown in the getting started example.
