# Workflows

Workflows are triggered by events or timers. Use `on()` for event-driven tasks and `every()` for schedules.

```ts
import { every, on } from 'workflows.do'

every('hour during business hours', async (_, { ai, db }) => {
  // perform periodic work
})

on('CreditApp.Submitted', async (event, { ai, db }) => {
  // react to external events
})
```

Workflows coordinate calls to your functions and database so tasks can run automatically.
