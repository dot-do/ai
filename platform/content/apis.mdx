# APIs

Use APIs to connect your workflows with external systems. The SDK exposes a simple fetch wrapper so you can call any HTTP endpoint.

```ts
import { api } from 'workflows.do'

const data = await api.get('https://example.com/data')
```

Combine API calls with your AI functions and database to automate entire processes.
