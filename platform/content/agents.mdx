# Agents

Agents are autonomous workers that execute your workflows. They can be human-assisted or fully automated.

```ts
import { Agent } from 'agents.do'

const marketingBot = Agent({ name: 'Marketing Bot' })
```

Agents receive tasks from workflows and can interact with functions, APIs, or humans to complete them.
