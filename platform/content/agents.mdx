# Agents

Agents are autonomous workers that execute your workflows. They can be human-assisted or fully automated.

```ts
import { Agent } from 'agents.do'
import { every } from 'workflows.do'

const marketingBot = Agent({
  name: 'Marketing Bot',
  objective: 'Keep users engaged',
  keyResults: ['▲ CTR to 8%', '▲ activation rate to 60%', '▼ churn to 2% monthly'],

  sendNewsletter: async ({ to, topic }, { ai, email }) => {
    const content = await ai.writeNewsletter({ topic })
    await email.to(to, 'Weekly Update', content)
  },
})

every('week on Mon', async () => {
  await marketingBot.sendNewsletter({
    to: 'subscribers@turboloans.co',
    topic: 'loan tips',
  })
})
```

Agents receive tasks from workflows and can interact with functions, APIs, or humans to complete them.
