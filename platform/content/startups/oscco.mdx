  vision: '24/7 AI OSC that responds in under 60 seconds across web, SMS, voice, and social; qualifies, answers builder-specific FAQs, and books model or virtual tours directly to the correct community calendar',
  leanCanvas: {
    problem: [
      'Slow speed-to-lead: 40–60% of builder web/form leads receive first response after 10+ minutes or not at all, causing 8–15% lower contact and appointment rates',
      'No after-hours coverage: 55–70% of inquiries arrive outside 9–5; most builders lack 24/7 response, leaking high-intent traffic to competitors',
      'Inconsistent qualification and scripting across OSCs leads to poor data hygiene in CRM (missing budget/timeline/location; 20–35% duplicate or incomplete records)',
      'Manual appointment coordination across communities and sales teams drives friction (no-shows, double-bookings, and poor calendar utilization)',
      'High cost per kept appointment using human-only OSC or outsourced ISAs ($120–$300 per kept appt) with volatile quality and limited scalability',
      'Fragmented channel handling (web chat, forms, SMS, FB/IG lead ads, phone) results in untracked conversations and poor attribution'
    ],
    solution: [
      'Always-on concierge: inbound triage across web forms, chat widgets, SMS, Facebook/Instagram lead ads, and tracked phone numbers with sub-60s first response',
      'Structured qualification: collects budget, timeline, location/community preference, household needs, financing status, and contact preferences; enforces required CRM fields',
      'Real-time FAQs: incentives, HOA/amenities, floor plans, lot availability windows, school districts, commute times, warranty—kept current via CMS/feeds',
      'Automatic scheduling: checks builder calendars by community/sales agent, books in-person or virtual tours, sends confirmations and reminders, manages reschedules/cancellations',
      'Smart routing and escalation: detects hot leads and patches to live OSC/agent, or schedules callbacks; de-duplicates and merges with existing CRM contacts',
      'Compliance-by-design: TCPA consent capture and logging, fair-housing guardrails, language accessibility (EN/ES), audit trails of all messages and calls'
    ],
    uniqueValueProposition: '24/7 AI OSC that responds in under 60 seconds across web, SMS, voice, and social; qualifies, answers builder-specific FAQs, and books model or virtual tours directly to the correct community calendar—cutting cost per kept appointment by 30–50% while improving CRM hygiene and after-hours coverage to 100%.',
    unfairAdvantage: 'Builder-specific corpus, integrations, and playbooks tuned for NAICS 236117 workflows; fair-housing and TCPA guardrails embedded at the core; growing network effects from cross-builder benchmarks (by market, time-of-day, channel) that continuously improve contact, set, and show rates.',
