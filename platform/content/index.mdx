# .do Platform Overview

The `.do` toolkit brings together AI functions, databases, and durable workflows. With a few lines of code you can store data, run AI models, and react to events.

```ts
import { ai, db } from 'workflows.do'

await db.ideas.create({ concept: 'Digital AI Workers' })
await db.ideas.create({ concept: 'Agentic Workflow Platform' })

const ideas = await db.ideas.search('AI Agents')
```

The rest of the docs dive deeper into each piece of the platformâ€”Functions, Workflows, the Database, and how they combine to automate your business.
