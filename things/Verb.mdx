Base type for all relationship and action types in the semantic system.

## Purpose

Verbs represent **relationships** between things - actions, properties, and connections. They are the predicates in semantic triples.

## Verb Forms

Action verbs have multiple conjugated forms:

- **Base** - achieve
- **Third person** - achieves
- **Past tense** - achieved
- **Object noun** - achievement
- **Opposite** - fail
- **Inverse** - achievedBy (for reverse/passive queries)

## Examples

### Action Verbs

- **achieve** - Accomplish something
- **create** - Deliberately produce something
- **buy** - Give money for goods/services

### Property Verbs

- **name** - The name of something
- **description** - A description
- **location** - Where something is located

## Usage

```typescript
import { $ } from 'sdk.do'

// Use a verb to create a relationship
await db.relate(user, $.achieve, goal)

// Query using inverse (passive form)
const achievers = await db.related(goal, $.achievedBy, $.Person)
```

## vs. Nouns

- **Nouns** are things (subjects and objects)
- **Verbs** are relationships and actions (predicates)

## Schema.org Reference

[Verb](https://schema.org/Action) in Schema.org vocabulary.
