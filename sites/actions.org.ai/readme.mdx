# actions.org.ai

**An open-source ontology of triggers and actions in Business-as-Code for AI agents**

actions.org.ai provides a standardized vocabulary for defining triggers, actions, and workflows in Business-as-Code systems. It enables AI agents to understand and execute business logic through a semantic ontology of actionable operations.

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Semantic Actions

Define actions with rich metadata that AI agents can understand and execute:

```typescript
{
  "$type": "Action",
  "$id": "https://actions.org.ai/SendEmail",
  "name": "SendEmail",
  "description": "Send an email message",
  "input": {
    "$type": "EmailMessage",
    "to": "string",
    "subject": "string",
    "body": "string"
  },
  "output": {
    "$type": "EmailDeliveryResult",
    "messageId": "string",
    "status": "string"
  }
}
```

### âš¡ Trigger Definitions

Define when and how actions should be executed:

```typescript
{
  "$type": "Trigger",
  "$id": "https://actions.org.ai/OnEmailReceived",
  "name": "OnEmailReceived",
  "description": "Triggered when an email is received",
  "event": "EmailReceived",
  "condition": "email.subject.contains('urgent')",
  "action": {
    "$ref": "https://actions.org.ai/SendNotification"
  }
}
```

### ðŸ”— Integration with Related Ontologies

actions.org.ai is part of a broader ecosystem:

- **[agents.org.ai](https://agents.org.ai)**: Ontology for AI agent definitions and capabilities
- **[triggers.org.ai](https://triggers.org.ai)**: Specialized ontology for event triggers
- **[searches.org.ai](https://searches.org.ai)**: Ontology for search and discovery operations

## Core Concepts

### Actions

Actions represent executable operations that can be performed by AI agents or systems:

- **Atomic Actions**: Single, indivisible operations (e.g., SendEmail, CreateRecord)
- **Composite Actions**: Sequences or workflows of multiple actions
- **Conditional Actions**: Actions that execute based on conditions
- **Parallel Actions**: Actions that can execute concurrently

### Triggers

Triggers define the conditions under which actions are executed:

- **Event Triggers**: Respond to specific events (e.g., OnFileCreated, OnDataChanged)
- **Schedule Triggers**: Execute actions on a schedule (e.g., Daily, Hourly)
- **Condition Triggers**: Execute when conditions are met (e.g., ThresholdExceeded)
- **Manual Triggers**: Explicitly invoked by users or systems

### Workflows

Workflows compose actions and triggers into business processes:

```typescript
{
  "$type": "Workflow",
  "$id": "https://actions.org.ai/workflows/CustomerOnboarding",
  "name": "CustomerOnboarding",
  "description": "Onboard new customers",
  "trigger": {
    "$ref": "https://actions.org.ai/OnCustomerCreated"
  },
  "steps": [
    {
      "$ref": "https://actions.org.ai/SendWelcomeEmail"
    },
    {
      "$ref": "https://actions.org.ai/CreateCustomerProfile"
    },
    {
      "$ref": "https://actions.org.ai/AssignAccountManager"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Use Cases

### Business Process Automation

Define and execute business processes with semantic clarity:

```mdx
---
$type: Workflow
$id: https://example.com/workflows/invoice-processing
name: Invoice Processing
description: Automated invoice processing workflow
trigger:
  $type: Trigger
  event: InvoiceReceived
steps:
  - $type: Action
    name: ValidateInvoice
  - $type: Action
    name: ApproveInvoice
  - $type: Action
    name: ProcessPayment
---

# Invoice Processing Workflow

This workflow automatically processes incoming invoices...
```

### AI Agent Orchestration

Enable AI agents to understand and execute complex operations:

```typescript
import { getAction, getTrigger, executeWorkflow } from 'actions.org.ai'

// AI agent discovers available actions
const availableActions = await getActionsByCategory('Communication')

// Execute action based on natural language intent
const action = await getAction('SendEmail')
const result = await executeWorkflow({
  action,
  input: {
    to: 'user@example.com',
    subject: 'Hello',
    body: 'Message content',
  },
})
```

### Event-Driven Architectures

Define event-driven systems with semantic triggers:

```typescript
{
  "$type": "EventDrivenSystem",
  "$id": "https://example.com/systems/order-processing",
  "name": "Order Processing System",
  "triggers": [
    {
      "$type": "Trigger",
      "event": "OrderCreated",
      "action": { "$ref": "https://actions.org.ai/ProcessOrder" }
    },
    {
      "$type": "Trigger",
      "event": "PaymentReceived",
      "action": { "$ref": "https://actions.org.ai/FulfillOrder" }
    }
  ]
}
```

## API Reference

### Action Lookup

```typescript
import { getAction, getAllActions, getActionsByCategory } from 'actions.org.ai'

// Get specific action
const sendEmailAction = getAction('SendEmail')

// Get all actions
const allActions = getAllActions()

// Get actions by category
const communicationActions = getActionsByCategory('Communication')
```

### Trigger Lookup

```typescript
import { getTrigger, getAllTriggers, getTriggersByEvent } from 'actions.org.ai'

// Get specific trigger
const onEmailTrigger = getTrigger('OnEmailReceived')

// Get all triggers
const allTriggers = getAllTriggers()

// Get triggers by event type
const emailTriggers = getTriggersByEvent('Email')
```

### Workflow Execution

```typescript
import { executeWorkflow, validateWorkflow, getWorkflow } from 'actions.org.ai'

// Get workflow definition
const workflow = getWorkflow('CustomerOnboarding')

// Validate workflow
const validation = validateWorkflow(workflow)

// Execute workflow
const result = await executeWorkflow(workflow, {
  customerId: '12345',
})
```

## Integration with `.do` Platform

actions.org.ai integrates seamlessly with the `.do` platform's Business-as-Code SDK:

```typescript
import { $, on, send } from 'sdk.do'

// Define action using .do SDK
$.action('sendEmail', async (params) => {
  // Implementation
})

// Define trigger using .do SDK
on('email.received', async (event) => {
  // Handle event
})

// Send events
send('order.created', orderData)
```

## Action Categories

Actions are organized into semantic categories:

- **Communication**: Email, SMS, Notifications, Messages
- **Data**: Create, Read, Update, Delete operations
- **Integration**: API calls, Webhooks, External services
- **Workflow**: Conditional logic, Loops, Branching
- **Computation**: Calculations, Transformations, Validations
- **Storage**: File operations, Database operations
- **Monitoring**: Logging, Metrics, Alerts
