# triggers.org.ai

**An open-source ontology of triggers in Business-as-Code**

triggers.org.ai provides a comprehensive vocabulary for defining event triggers in autonomous business systems, working alongside [actions.org.ai](https://actions.org.ai) and [searches.org.ai](https://searches.org.ai) as part of the [agents.org.ai](https://agents.org.ai) ecosystem.

## Overview

Triggers are the foundational event patterns that initiate workflows and processes in Business-as-Code systems. This ontology defines a structured vocabulary for describing when, how, and under what conditions business processes should be activated.

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Event-Driven Architecture

triggers.org.ai defines triggers across multiple categories:

- **Time-based Triggers**: Scheduled events, intervals, and temporal patterns
- **Data Triggers**: Changes in data state, thresholds, and conditions
- **User Triggers**: User actions, interactions, and behaviors
- **System Triggers**: Application events, webhooks, and API calls
- **Business Triggers**: Business rules, KPIs, and domain-specific events

### ðŸ”— MDXLD Integration

Like other `.do` platform ontologies, triggers.org.ai uses the `$` prefix for linked data properties:

```mdx
---
$type: Trigger
$id: https://example.com/triggers/daily-report
name: Daily Report Generation
schedule:
  $type: CronSchedule
  expression: '0 9 * * *'
  timezone: America/New_York
action:
  $type: Action
  $id: https://example.com/actions/generate-report
---

# Daily Report Trigger

Generates a daily business report every morning at 9 AM EST.
```

### ðŸ¤– AI-Native Design

- **Type-safe**: Full TypeScript definitions for all trigger types
- **Composable**: Combine triggers with logical operators (AND, OR, NOT)
- **Contextual**: Rich metadata for AI systems to understand trigger intent
- **Extensible**: Easy to define custom domain-specific triggers

## Core Trigger Types

### ScheduleTrigger

Time-based triggers for recurring and one-time scheduled events.

```typescript
import type { ScheduleTrigger } from 'triggers.org.ai/types'

const dailyTrigger: ScheduleTrigger = {
  $type: 'ScheduleTrigger',
  $id: 'https://example.com/triggers/daily-backup',
  name: 'Daily Backup',
  schedule: {
    $type: 'CronSchedule',
    expression: '0 2 * * *',
  },
}
```

### DataChangeTrigger

Triggers based on changes to data state or values.

```typescript
import type { DataChangeTrigger } from 'triggers.org.ai/types'

const inventoryTrigger: DataChangeTrigger = {
  $type: 'DataChangeTrigger',
  $id: 'https://example.com/triggers/low-inventory',
  name: 'Low Inventory Alert',
  dataSource: 'inventory',
  condition: {
    $type: 'Condition',
    property: 'quantity',
    operator: 'lessThan',
    value: 10,
  },
}
```

### WebhookTrigger

Triggers activated by incoming HTTP requests or webhooks.

```typescript
import type { WebhookTrigger } from 'triggers.org.ai/types'

const paymentTrigger: WebhookTrigger = {
  $type: 'WebhookTrigger',
  $id: 'https://example.com/triggers/payment-received',
  name: 'Payment Received',
  endpoint: '/webhooks/payment',
  method: 'POST',
  authentication: {
    $type: 'WebhookAuthentication',
    scheme: 'hmac-sha256',
  },
}
```

### UserActionTrigger

Triggers based on user interactions and behaviors.

```typescript
import type { UserActionTrigger } from 'triggers.org.ai/types'

const onboardingTrigger: UserActionTrigger = {
  $type: 'UserActionTrigger',
  $id: 'https://example.com/triggers/user-signup',
  name: 'User Signup',
  actionType: 'signup',
  properties: {
    plan: 'premium',
  },
}
```

### CompositeTrigger

Combine multiple triggers with logical operators.

```typescript
import type { CompositeTrigger } from 'triggers.org.ai/types'

const complexTrigger: CompositeTrigger = {
  $type: 'CompositeTrigger',
  $id: 'https://example.com/triggers/complex-alert',
  name: 'Complex Alert',
  operator: 'AND',
  triggers: [
    {
      $type: 'DataChangeTrigger',
      property: 'temperature',
      operator: 'greaterThan',
      value: 80,
    },
    {
      $type: 'ScheduleTrigger',
      schedule: {
        $type: 'TimeWindow',
        start: '09:00',
        end: '17:00',
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

## Integration with agents.org.ai

triggers.org.ai is part of the autonomous Business-as-Code ecosystem:

- **triggers.org.ai**: Defines WHEN processes should run (this ontology)
- **actions.org.ai**: Defines WHAT should be done
- **searches.org.ai**: Defines HOW to find information
- **agents.org.ai**: Orchestrates triggers, actions, and searches into autonomous workflows

### Example Agent Workflow

```mdx
---
$type: Agent
$id: https://example.com/agents/inventory-manager
name: Inventory Management Agent
trigger:
  $type: DataChangeTrigger
  $id: https://example.com/triggers/low-inventory
  dataSource: inventory
  condition:
    property: quantity
    operator: lessThan
    value: 10
search:
  $type: Search
  $id: https://example.com/searches/find-supplier
  query: preferred suppliers for {product}
action:
  $type: Action
  $id: https://example.com/actions/reorder-stock
  workflow:
    - notify supplier
    - create purchase order
    - update inventory forecast
---

# Inventory Management Agent

Automatically monitors inventory levels and initiates reordering when stock falls below threshold.
```

## API Reference

### Trigger Creation

```typescript
import { createTrigger, validateTrigger } from 'triggers.org.ai'

const trigger = createTrigger({
  $type: 'ScheduleTrigger',
  name: 'Weekly Report',
  schedule: {
    $type: 'CronSchedule',
    expression: '0 9 * * 1',
  },
})

const validation = validateTrigger(trigger)
```

### Trigger Evaluation

```typescript
import { evaluateTrigger, shouldFire } from 'triggers.org.ai'

const context = {
  timestamp: new Date(),
  data: { temperature: 85 },
}

const result = evaluateTrigger(trigger, context)
if (shouldFire(result)) {
  // Execute associated action
}
```

### Trigger Registry

```typescript
import { registerTrigger, getTrigger, getAllTriggers } from 'triggers.org.ai'

// Register custom trigger
registerTrigger(customTrigger)

// Retrieve trigger
const trigger = getTrigger('https://example.com/triggers/custom')

// List all triggers
const allTriggers = getAllTriggers()
```

## Trigger Categories

### Temporal Triggers

- `ScheduleTrigger`: Cron expressions, intervals, specific dates
- `TimeWindowTrigger`: Triggers within specific time ranges
- `DurationTrigger`: After a duration has elapsed
- `DeadlineTrigger`: Before a deadline is reached

### Data Triggers

- `DataChangeTrigger`: When data changes
- `ThresholdTrigger`: When values cross thresholds
- `PatternTrigger`: When data matches patterns
- `AnomalyTrigger`: When anomalies are detected

### Event Triggers

- `WebhookTrigger`: HTTP webhooks
- `MessageTrigger`: Message queue events
- `StreamTrigger`: Real-time stream events
- `APITrigger`: External API events

### Business Triggers

- `KPITrigger`: Key performance indicators
- `SLATrigger`: Service level agreements
- `ComplianceTrigger`: Regulatory compliance events
- `WorkflowTrigger`: Business process states

## Use Cases

### Automated Reporting

```mdx
---
$type: Trigger
$id: https://example.com/triggers/monthly-report
name: Monthly Financial Report
schedule:
  $type: CronSchedule
  expression: '0 0 1 * *'
  description: First day of every month at midnight
notification:
  channels: [email, slack]
  recipients: [finance-team]
---
```

### Real-time Monitoring

```mdx
---
$type: CompositeTrigger
$id: https://example.com/triggers/system-alert
name: Critical System Alert
operator: OR
triggers:
  - $type: ThresholdTrigger
    metric: cpu_usage
    operator: greaterThan
    value: 90
  - $type: ThresholdTrigger
    metric: error_rate
    operator: greaterThan
    value: 5
priority: critical
---
```

### Customer Journey

```mdx
---
$type: UserActionTrigger
$id: https://example.com/triggers/onboarding-complete
name: Onboarding Completed
actionType: complete_onboarding
followUp:
  $type: ScheduleTrigger
  delay: 24h
  action: send_welcome_email
---
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Descriptive Names

Use clear, descriptive names that explain the trigger's purpose:

```typescript
// Good
name: 'Low Inventory Alert for Critical Items'

// Bad
name: 'trigger1'
```

### 2. Documented Conditions

Always document the business logic behind trigger conditions:

```mdx
---
$type: Trigger
name: High-Value Customer Alert
description: |
  Triggers when a customer's lifetime value exceeds $10,000
  to initiate premium support tier upgrade process
---
```

### 3. Error Handling

Define fallback behavior for trigger evaluation failures:

```typescript
const trigger = {
  $type: 'DataChangeTrigger',
  errorHandling: {
    retryAttempts: 3,
    backoffStrategy: 'exponential',
    fallbackAction: 'log-and-notify',
  },
}
```

### 4. Testing Triggers

Always test triggers in development before deploying:

```typescript
import { testTrigger, mockContext } from 'triggers.org.ai/testing'

const context = mockContext({
  timestamp: new Date('2024-01-15T09:00:00Z'),
  data: { inventory: 5 },
})

const result = testTrigger(lowInventoryTrigger, context)
expect(result.shouldFire).toBe(true)
```
