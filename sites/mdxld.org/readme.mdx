# MDXLD

**The Best Document Format for Agentic AI**

MDXLD is a revolutionary document format that combines four essential capabilities into one cohesive standard, making it the ideal choice for building with Agentic AI.

## What is MDXLD?

MDXLD (Markdown + MDX + Linked Data) is a **4-in-1 document format** that unifies:

1. **Structured Data** (YAML frontmatter)
2. **Unstructured Content** (Markdown)
3. **Executable Code** (ES Modules - JavaScript/TypeScript)
4. **UI Components** (JSX/React)

This unique combination enables documents that are simultaneously human-readable, machine-processable, executable, and interactive.

## Why MDXLD for Agentic AI?

Agentic AI systems need to work with diverse types of information. Traditional formats force you to choose between structure and flexibility, between data and content, between code and documentation. MDXLD eliminates these trade-offs.

### The 4-in-1 Advantage

#### 1. Structured Data (YAML Frontmatter)

Strong typing and linked data semantics with `$id`, `$type`, and `$context`:

```yaml
---
$id: https://example.com/articles/ai-agents
$type: Article
$context: https://schema.org
title: Building AI Agents
author: Jane Developer
published: 2025-10-07
tags: [AI, Agents, Automation]
---
```

The `$type` field enables TypeScript discriminated unions, unlocking strong type safety across your entire codebase. Support for schema.org (and the AI-native superset schema.org.ai) means your documents speak the language of the semantic web.

#### 2. Unstructured Content (Markdown)

Rich, human-readable content that AI can parse and understand:

```markdown
# Building AI Agents

AI agents are autonomous systems that can perceive their environment,
make decisions, and take actions to achieve goals.

## Key Capabilities

- Reasoning and planning
- Tool usage and API integration
- Memory and context management
```

#### 3. Executable Code (ES Modules)

Import and use JavaScript/TypeScript directly in your documents:

```mdx
import { fetchData, processResults } from './utils'
import { Chart } from './components/Chart'

export const data = await fetchData('/api/metrics')
export const processed = processResults(data

)
```

This means your documents can be **executable programs** - they can fetch data, run computations, and integrate with any JavaScript ecosystem tool.

#### 4. UI Components (JSX/React)

Rich, interactive experiences that render anywhere:

```jsx
<Chart data={processed} />

<InteractiveDemo
  title="Try it yourself"
  onSubmit={handleSubmit}
/>
```

Components can render to:

- **Web** - Rich browser experiences
- **Mobile** - Native mobile apps via React Native
- **CLI** - Terminal interfaces
- **Slack/Discord** - Chat integrations
- **REST/RPC/MCP** - API responses
- **Plain Markdown** - Degraded gracefully for simple consumers

## Universal Rendering

MDXLD's component model is universally adaptable. The same document can render as:

- A rich web application with interactive charts
- A mobile app with native controls
- A CLI tool with formatted terminal output
- A Slack message with action buttons
- A PDF document with static content
- Plain markdown for AI processing

This "write once, render anywhere" philosophy makes MDXLD perfect for building systems that need to communicate across multiple channels.

## The MDXLD Package

The [`mdxld` npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mdxld) provides the core parsing and serialization functionality:

```bash
pnpm add mdxld
```

```typescript
import { parseMDXLD, stringifyMDXLD } from 'mdxld'

// Parse MDXLD with linked data
const doc = parseMDXLD(mdxString)

// Access structured data
console.log(doc.data.$type) // 'Article'
console.log(doc.data.title) // 'Building AI Agents'

// Work with content
console.log(doc.content) // Markdown content
```

The package is:

-  **Zero dependencies** - Works everywhere
-  **Lightweight** - <3KB minified
-  **Universal** - Browser, Node.js, edge workers
-  **Tree-shakeable** - Import only what you need
-  **TypeScript-first** - Full type safety

## Two Shape Variants

MDXLD supports two formats for maximum flexibility:

### Nested Format ($ prefix)

```typescript
{
  data: {
    $id: 'https://example.com/post/1',
    $type: 'BlogPost',
    title: 'Hello World'
  },
  content: '# Content here'
}
```

### Flattened Format (root-level)

```typescript
{
  id: 'https://example.com/post/1',
  type: 'BlogPost',
  data: {
    title: 'Hello World'
  },
  content: '# Content here'
}
```

Both formats are interchangeable, allowing you to choose the structure that best fits your use case.

## Use Cases

### AI Agent Knowledge Bases

Store agent instructions, context, and executable tools in a single document:

```mdx
---
$type: AgentInstruction
agent: customer-support
capabilities: [email, search, escalate]
---

# Customer Support Agent

You are a helpful customer support agent...

import { searchKnowledgeBase, sendEmail, escalateToHuman } from './tools'

export const tools = {
  searchKnowledgeBase,
  sendEmail,
  escalateToHuman

}
```

### Dynamic Documentation

Documentation that's always up-to-date because it executes against live systems:

```mdx
---
$type: APIDocumentation
endpoint: /api/users
---

# Users API

import { fetchAPISchema } from './utils'

export const schema = await fetchAPISchema('/api/users')

<APIReference schema={schema} />
```

### Interactive Notebooks

Like Jupyter notebooks, but with the full power of the JavaScript ecosystem:

```mdx
---
$type: Notebook
title: Data Analysis Pipeline
---

import { loadDataset, analyze, visualize } from './analytics'

export const data = await loadDataset('./sales.csv')
export const results = analyze(data)

<DataTable data={data} />
<Chart results={results} />
```

### Multi-Channel Content

Create once, deploy everywhere:

```mdx
---
$type: Announcement
channels: [web, slack, email, cli]
---

# New Feature Launch

We're excited to announce...

<CTAButton text="Learn More" url="https://example.com/feature" renderAs={{ web: 'button', slack: 'link', email: 'html', cli: 'text' }} />
```

## Why Not Just Use...?

### Markdown?

No structured data, no code execution, no components.

### JSON?

Not human-readable, no rich content, poor for long-form text.

### MDX?

No standardized metadata format, no linked data semantics.

### Jupyter Notebooks?

Python-centric, heavy dependencies, poor git integration.

### Word/PDF?

Not machine-readable, not executable, not version-controllable.

MDXLD gives you the best of all worlds.

## The Standard

MDXLD is more than just a package - it's an open standard for building the next generation of AI-powered applications. The standard defines:

1. **Frontmatter Schema** - How to structure metadata with `$id`, `$type`, and `$context`
2. **Content Format** - How to combine Markdown, JSX, and ES modules
3. **Type System** - How to use discriminated unions for type safety
4. **Rendering Model** - How to render components across platforms
5. **Linked Data Integration** - How to connect to schema.org and the semantic web

## Get Started

```bash
# Install the package
pnpm add mdxld

# Try it out
import { parseMDXLD } from 'mdxld'

const doc = parseMDXLD(`
---
$type: Article
title: My First MDXLD Document
---

# Hello MDXLD!

This is a **structured**, _executable_, and interactive document.
`)

console.log(doc.data.$type) // 'Article'
```

## The Future

MDXLD is designed for a world where AI agents are first-class citizens in our software systems. As these agents become more sophisticated, they'll need formats that are:

- **Structured** enough for reliable parsing
- **Flexible** enough for creative expression
- **Executable** enough for dynamic behavior
- **Interactive** enough for rich experiences

MDXLD is that format.
