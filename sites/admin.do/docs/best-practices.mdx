# Best Practices

Best practices for using admin.do effectively and securely.

## Security

### Principle of Least Privilege

Grant users only the permissions they need for their role.

### Regular Access Reviews

Audit user permissions quarterly and remove unnecessary access.

### Enable MFA

Require multi-factor authentication for all admin users.

### Secure Session Management

- Use httpOnly, secure cookies
- Set appropriate session timeouts
- Implement session invalidation on role changes

## User Management

### Clear Role Definitions

Define roles with clear responsibilities and permissions.

### Naming Conventions

Use consistent naming for roles and permissions (e.g., `resource.action`).

### Onboarding/Offboarding

- Automate user provisioning
- Immediately revoke access on offboarding

## Monitoring

### Track Key Metrics

- Active users
- Permission changes
- Failed login attempts
- System resource usage

### Set Up Alerts

Alert on suspicious activity like:

- Multiple failed logins
- Permission escalations
- Unusual access patterns

## Audit Logging

### Log All Changes

Record every administrative action with full context.

### Retain Logs Appropriately

Follow compliance requirements for log retention.

### Regular Audits

Review audit logs regularly for security and compliance.
