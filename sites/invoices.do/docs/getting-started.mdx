# Getting Started with invoices.do

This guide will help you set up invoices.do and create your first invoice.

## Installation

```bash
pnpm add sdk.do
```

## Your First Invoice

```typescript
import $, { db } from 'sdk.do'

const invoice = await db.create($.Invoice, {
  $type: 'Invoice',
  invoiceNumber: 'INV-2025-001',
  dateIssued: new Date().toISOString(),
  customer: {
    $type: 'Person',
    name: 'Jane Smith',
    email: 'jane@example.com',
  },
  totalPaymentDue: {
    $type: 'PriceSpecification',
    price: 299.99,
    priceCurrency: 'USD',
  },
  paymentDueDate: new Date(Date.now() + 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000).toISOString(),
  paymentStatus: 'PaymentDue',
})
```
