# Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions for worker fleet management.

## Scaling Issues

### Fleet Not Scaling Up

**Problem**: Fleet not adding workers despite high demand

**Solutions**:

- Check max scaling limit not reached
- Verify scaling metric is calculated correctly
- Review scale-up threshold settings
- Check for resource constraints (memory, CPU)

### Fleet Not Scaling Down

**Problem**: Workers not being removed when idle

**Solutions**:

- Verify scale-down threshold is set correctly
- Check cooldown period hasn't locked scaling
- Review minimum fleet size setting
- Ensure tasks are completing properly

## Performance Issues

### High Task Latency

**Problem**: Tasks taking too long to complete

**Solutions**:

- Scale up fleet to reduce per-worker load
- Optimize worker code for performance
- Check for bottlenecks in dependencies
- Review task complexity and distribution

### Low Throughput

**Problem**: Fleet processing fewer tasks than expected

**Solutions**:

- Check for worker failures or errors
- Review load distribution strategy
- Optimize task queue management
- Scale up if at capacity

## Worker Health Issues

### Frequent Worker Failures

**Problem**: Workers crashing or becoming unresponsive

**Solutions**:

- Review worker logs for error patterns
- Check resource limits (memory, timeout)
- Validate LLM API connectivity
- Implement better error handling

### Inconsistent Worker Performance

**Problem**: Some workers much slower than others

**Solutions**:

- Check for uneven load distribution
- Review worker resource allocation
- Monitor external API latencies
- Implement performance-based routing
