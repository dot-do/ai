# Architecture

Worker fleet architecture for managing and orchestrating multiple autonomous workers.

## Core Components

### 1. Fleet Manager

Coordinates worker lifecycle, scaling decisions, and resource allocation.

### 2. Load Balancer

Distributes work across workers based on current load, capabilities, and priorities.

### 3. Health Monitor

Tracks worker health, performance metrics, and detects failures.

### 4. Auto-Scaler

Dynamically adjusts fleet size based on demand and performance metrics.

## Scaling Strategies

### Horizontal Scaling

Add/remove workers based on demand.

### Vertical Scaling

Adjust worker capabilities or resource allocation.

### Predictive Scaling

Scale proactively based on historical patterns and forecasts.

## Load Distribution

### Round Robin

Distribute tasks evenly across all workers.

### Load Balanced

Send tasks to workers with lowest current load.

### Capability-Based

Route tasks to workers with specific capabilities.

### Priority-Based

Assign high-priority tasks to best-performing workers.

## Fault Tolerance

### Health Checks

Regular pings to ensure worker responsiveness.

### Automatic Recovery

Restart failed workers automatically.

### Task Reassignment

Redistribute tasks from failed workers to healthy ones.
