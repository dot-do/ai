# Best Practices

Best practices for managing worker fleets effectively.

## Fleet Sizing

### Start Conservative

Begin with minimum viable fleet size and scale up based on demand.

### Monitor Utilization

Target 70-80% utilization for optimal efficiency without overload.

### Set Appropriate Limits

Define reasonable min/max scaling limits to control costs.

## Load Distribution

### Use Capability-Based Routing

Match tasks to workers with appropriate skills and expertise.

### Implement Priority Queues

Process high-priority tasks first while maintaining fairness.

### Balance Workload

Avoid overloading individual workers while others sit idle.

## Health Monitoring

### Regular Health Checks

Ping workers every 30-60 seconds to detect failures quickly.

### Track Performance Metrics

Monitor throughput, error rates, and completion times.

### Set Alert Thresholds

Alert on abnormal patterns before they become critical.

## Scaling Strategy

### Use Predictive Scaling

Anticipate demand spikes based on historical patterns.

### Implement Cooldown Periods

Prevent rapid scale up/down cycles with cooldown timers.

### Test Scaling Policies

Validate scaling behavior under load before production.

## Cost Optimization

### Right-Size Workers

Use appropriate model sizes for task complexity.

### Implement Idle Shutdown

Terminate idle workers after threshold period.

### Use Spot/Preemptible Instances

Leverage lower-cost compute for non-critical workloads.
