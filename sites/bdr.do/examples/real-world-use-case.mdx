# Real-World Use Case

Production implementation of BDR agents for a SaaS company building strategic partnerships.

## Scenario

A B2B SaaS company needs to build 10 strategic partnerships per year to expand into new markets and increase revenue by $2M annually.

## Implementation

### 1. Create BDR Team

```typescript
import { $, bdr } from 'sdk.do'

const bdTeam = await Promise.all([
  bdr.create({
    name: 'Alex Morgan',
    focus: { verticals: ['FinTech'], partnershipTypes: ['Strategic Alliances'] },
    quota: { partnershipsSignedPerYear: 10, revenueFromPartners: 2000000 },
    model: 'claude-sonnet-4.5',
  }),
  bdr.create({
    name: 'Jamie Chen',
    focus: { verticals: ['Healthcare'], partnershipTypes: ['Integration Partners'] },
    quota: { partnershipsSignedPerYear: 8, revenueFromPartners: 1500000 },
    model: 'gpt-5',
  }),
])
```

### 2. Automated Opportunity Pipeline

```typescript
import { $, bdr, on, every } from 'sdk.do'

// Weekly opportunity identification
every($.Weekly, async () => {
  for (const agent of bdTeam) {
    const opportunities = await agent.identifyOpportunities({
      criteria: agent.focus,
      limit: 5,
    })

    for (const opp of opportunities) {
      await send($.Partnership.opportunity_identified, { agent, opportunity: opp })
    }
  }
})

// Automated research and outreach
on($.Partnership.opportunity_identified, async (event) => {
  const { agent, opportunity } = event
  await agent.researchPartner(opportunity.company)
  await agent.createOutreachStrategy(opportunity)
})
```

### 3. Partnership Development Workflow

```typescript
async function developPartnershipWorkflow(agent, opportunity) {
  // Stage 1: Research (Week 1-2)
  const research = await agent.researchPartner(opportunity.company)
  const stakeholders = await agent.mapStakeholders(opportunity.company)

  // Stage 2: Initial Outreach (Week 3-4)
  await agent.createPersonalizedOutreach({ stakeholders, research })

  // Stage 3: Qualification (Week 5-8)
  const qualified = await agent.qualifyOpportunity(opportunity)
  if (!qualified) return

  // Stage 4: Proposal (Week 9-12)
  const proposal = await agent.createProposal(opportunity)
  await agent.sendProposal(proposal)

  // Stage 5: Negotiation (Week 13-16)
  const negotiation = await agent.manageNegotiation(proposal)

  // Stage 6: Close (Week 17-20)
  return await agent.closePartnership(negotiation)
}
```

### 4. Performance Monitoring

```typescript
import { $, bdr, db } from 'sdk.do'

// Daily health checks
every($.Daily, async () => {
  for (const agent of bdTeam) {
    const metrics = await agent.getMetrics({ period: 'last_30_days' })

    if (metrics.partnerships.pipelineValue < agent.quota.pipelineValue * 0.5) {
      await send($.Alert.created, {
        severity: 'warning',
        message: `${agent.name} pipeline below target`,
        action: 'increase_prospecting',
      })
    }
  }
})
```

## Results

- **10 strategic partnerships** closed in first year
- **$2.1M revenue** from partner channel
- **65% win rate** on qualified opportunities
- **90 days average** time to close
