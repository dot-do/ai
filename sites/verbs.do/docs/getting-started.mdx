# Getting Started with verbs.do

Learn how to use semantic action verbs and operations in your Business-as-Code applications.

## What Are Verbs?

**Verbs** are operations that define **what you can do** with entities:

- **CRUD** - create, read, update, delete
- **Business Operations** - approve, process, fulfill, ship
- **Relationships** - assign, relate, connect, associate
- **Communication** - send, notify, message, email
- **GraphDL Predicates** - worksFor, owns, manages, produces

## Installation

```bash
pnpm add sdk.do
```

## Basic CRUD Operations

### Create

```typescript
import $, { db } from 'sdk.do'

const person = await $.create($.Person, {
  $type: 'Person',
  name: 'Jane Smith',
  email: 'jane@example.com',
})
```

### Read

```typescript
// Get by ID
const person = await $.get($.Person, 'person-123')

// List all
const people = await $.list($.Person)

// List with filters
const engineers = await $.list($.Person, {
  where: { jobTitle: { $contains: 'Engineer' } },
})
```

### Update

```typescript
await $.update(person, {
  jobTitle: 'Senior Engineer',
})
```

### Delete

```typescript
await $.delete(person)
```

## GraphDL Relationships

### Creating Relationships

```typescript
const person = await $.create($.Person, { name: 'John' })
const org = await $.create($.Organization, { name: 'Acme' })

// Create relationship
await db.relate(person, $.worksFor, org)
```

### Querying Relationships

```typescript
// Get related entities
const employer = await db.related(person, $.worksFor, $.Organization)
const employees = await db.related(org, $.employs, $.Person)
```

## Business Operations

```typescript
// Order processing
await $.process(order)
await $.fulfill(order)
await $.ship(order)

// Customer management
await $.qualify(lead)
await $.convert(lead)
```
