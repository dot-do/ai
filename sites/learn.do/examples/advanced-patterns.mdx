# Advanced Patterns

## AI-Powered Personalization

```typescript
import { learn, ai } from 'learn.do'

// Get personalized recommendations
const recommendations = await learn.recommend(user, {
  basedOn: 'history',
  includeSkillGaps: true,
  limit: 5,
})

// Adaptive learning paths
const adaptivePath = await learn.createAdaptivePath(user, {
  goal: 'full-stack-developer',
  assessCurrentSkills: true,
  adjustDifficulty: true,
})
```

## Corporate Training Management

```typescript
// Create team
const team = await learn.createTeam({
  name: 'Engineering Team',
  members: teamMembers,
})

// Assign training
await learn.assignTraining(team, {
  paths: ['backend-developer', 'api-design'],
  deadline: '2025-12-31',
})

// Track team progress
const teamProgress = await learn.teamProgress(team)
```
