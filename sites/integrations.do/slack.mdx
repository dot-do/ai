import { SlackClient } from '@dotdo/sdk.do/integrations/slack'

const slack = new SlackClient({
  apiKey: process.env.SLACK_API_KEY,
})

const result = await slack.action.execute({
  action: 'example_action',
  parameters: {},
})
```

## Actions

Slack provides 141 actions through the Composio API.

## Webhooks
