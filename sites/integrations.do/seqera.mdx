# Seqera Integration

Seqera Platform is an intuitive, centralized command post that enables data analysis at scale, allowing users to launch, manage, and monitor scalable Nextflow pipelines and compute environments on-premises or across cloud providers.

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { SeqeraClient } from '@dotdo/sdk.do/integrations/seqera'

const seqera = new SeqeraClient({
  apiKey: process.env.SEQERA_API_KEY,
})

const result = await seqera.action.execute({
  action: 'example_action',
  parameters: {},
})
```

## Actions

Seqera provides 8 actions through the Composio API.
