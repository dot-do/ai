# Troubleshooting

## Publishing Fails

Check workflow status:

```typescript
const status = await cms.workflows.getStatus(article)
console.log('Current stage:', status.stage)
console.log('Can publish:', status.canPublish)
```

## Media Upload Issues

Check storage configuration:

```bash
echo $CMS_MEDIA_STORAGE
# Verify credentials and permissions
```
